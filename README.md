# Online Retail Analysis Project

## Description

This project analyses a dataset of online retail transactions to provide insights and recommendations for improving business performance.

## Dataset

The analysis uses the [Online Retail](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online+retail)[^1] dataset from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/), which contains transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based online retail company.
